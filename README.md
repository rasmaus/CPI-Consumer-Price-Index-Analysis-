# 📊 India CPI Inflation Analysis (Excel Case Study)

## Overview

This project analyzes India’s Consumer Price Index (CPI) data to identify key inflation drivers, category-wise contributions, and long-term trends. The analysis focuses on urban and rural CPI indices and evaluates the impact of major economic events such as COVID-19.

## Dataset

* Source: Government of India CPI Inflation Data
* Time Period: 2017–2023
* Coverage: Urban and Rural CPI indices
* Categories: Food & Beverages, Clothing & Footwear, Housing & Utilities, Health, Education, Personal, Transportation

## Objectives

* Identify which broad categories contribute most to overall CPI
* Analyze year-on-year (YoY) inflation trends
* Evaluate food price movements over a 12-month window
* Assess the impact of COVID-19 on inflation patterns

## Key Analysis Performed

* Grouped 30+ sub-categories into broader CPI buckets
* Calculated category-wise contribution percentages summing to 100% per month
* Performed YoY trend analysis (2017–2022)
* Conducted 12-month food inflation analysis (Jun 2022 – May 2023)
* Compared pre-COVID vs post-COVID inflation behavior (before and after Mar 2020)
* Built interactive dashboards using Pivot Tables and Charts

## Key Findings

* December 2023 inflation was driven mainly by non-food essentials (Personal, Health, Clothing), contributing over ~45% of overall CPI impact
* 2019 recorded the highest inflation (~8%), driven by fuel price increases and supply chain disruptions
* Highest food inflation observed in June 2022
* Lowest food inflation observed in December 2022 and February 2023
* Post-COVID inflation showed higher volatility compared to the pre-COVID period

## Tools & Techniques

* Microsoft Excel
* Pivot Tables & Pivot Charts
* Conditional Formatting
* Trend Analysis
* Time Series Comparison

## Deliverables

* Category-wise contribution dashboard
* Rural vs Urban CPI comparison
* YoY inflation trend chart
* Food inflation analysis visuals
* COVID impact analysis chart

## Business Impact

This analysis enables policymakers and economists to understand inflation drivers, monitor category-wise risks, and make data-backed economic decisions.
